### How to use these cards
* Pair each JTBD with product benefit statements and feature proof-points.  
* Align upcoming copy (landing, email, in-app) to the KPI language the persona already tracks (e.g., “boost Net Dollar Retention by 6% in one quarter”).  
* Address pain-points head-on in social proof and objection-handling sections.
