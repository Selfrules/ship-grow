## The Golden Rule of Remote Work

Welcome to the **Remote Communication Playbook** where the supreme rule is:

> **If even one person is remote, then everyone is remote.**

In simple terms, *we all play by the same rules or no one has fun*. No more scenes where five colleagues are giggling in a meeting room while two unlucky souls at home listen to crackling audio. If your team has even one remote member, everyone joins the call individually and uses the same digital channels: *remote-first*, period.

Why? For **fairness**, **inclusion**, and because the alternative is a *nightmare of half-heard conversations* (can you hear me? who‚Äôs talking?). Plus, the spirit of **"pajama power"** shouldn‚Äôt be lost: even if you go to the office, keep the same principles as when you‚Äôre at home. Document everything, prefer async, and above all: *working well matters more than where you are*.

## The Laws of Async

When you‚Äôre not always face-to-face with colleagues, **asynchronous communication** becomes your secret weapon. Remotely, it‚Äôs sacred; in hybrid, it‚Äôs even more essential (because sometimes in the office you forget to update those connected elsewhere).

- **Synchronous** = "everyone connected in real time."
- **Asynchronous** = "everyone replies when they can (or want to)."

### üéØ Law 1: If you don‚Äôt need a call, don‚Äôt have a call

If the topic isn‚Äôt super urgent or complex, *don‚Äôt* start yet another meeting. A post on Teams, a comment on a shared file‚Ä¶ are perfect for syncing up *without* blocking everyone‚Äôs schedule. Remember: 1 hour of meeting with 6 people = 6 hours of collective work consumed.

### üéØ Law 2: One topic = one thread

You know those endless emails with 10 different topics? Avoid them like the plague. In remote/hybrid, one question = one channel, one topic = one thread and dedicated conversation. It helps everyone stay on track and respond more clearly.

### üéØ Law 3: Confirm receipt

Just like the internet does SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, in remote/hybrid we must *make sure* people have seen and understood information. A simple "Got it! üëç" in chat or "I‚Äôll handle it, thanks!" avoids the classic drama of "Oh, I thought you‚Äôd seen it‚Ä¶". It‚Äôs not micro-management, it‚Äôs common sense.

### üéØ Law 4: If it‚Äôs not written, it doesn‚Äôt exist

Whether it‚Äôs a task, a decision, or a meeting outcome: *write it down*. In the office, things are often said in passing, and remote folks miss out. Even if you‚Äôre **all** remote, human memory is fickle: without a written record, information vanishes or gets distorted.

## Surviving Meetings (Without Wasting Your Life)

### Right channel, right time

- **Teams chat**: for quick questions, instant coordination. If you‚Äôre pinging 10 times in 5 minutes, maybe it‚Äôs time for a quick call.
- **Email**: use for more formal/external communications or to recap decisions. *Not* for "Hi, how are you?" to the whole team.
- **Meetings**: a luxury, not a default. Use when you need *real* real-time interaction.

### Avoid "meeting-itis"

Packed calendars, call after call, people who can‚Äôt even find 10 minutes for coffee. Remember: **"This meeting could have been an email"** isn‚Äôt just a meme, it‚Äôs a warning.

## Tools That Work (If You Use Them Well)

- **Teams**: great for chat, channels, calls, shared files
- **Planner/Trello**: for visual task management
- **OneNote/Loop**: shared notebook for documenting decisions
- **To Do**: for personal task management

## Epic Fails to Avoid

1. **"One person on the phone, the rest in the room"**: remote folks feel like ghosts
2. **"Con-fusion"**: 5 people believe 5 different things
3. **"Tool Zoo"**: conversations scattered across too many platforms
4. **"Everything (falsely) urgent"**: if everything‚Äôs urgent, nothing is
5. **"Always on, always working"**: burnout, blurred home-work boundaries

## Becoming Async Masters

1. **Async stand-up**: a daily post instead of a 9:00am call
2. **Offline review**: comments in shared docs instead of review meetings
3. **Staggered brainstorming**: an online whiteboard where everyone contributes within 24 hours
4. **Project update**: weekly post instead of a mega call

## The 10 Commandments of Hybrid-Remote Work

1. **Remote-First**: If one person is remote, *everyone is*
2. **No useless meetings**: Time is the scarcest resource
3. **Honor the break**: No back-to-back meetings, protect focus
4. **Document everything**: If it‚Äôs not written, it doesn‚Äôt exist
5. **Include everyone**: Equal voice for in-person and remote
6. **Standardize tools**: Avoid the app jungle
7. **Respect others‚Äô time**: Think before tagging @everyone
8. **Be transparent**: Clarify your real availability
9. **Don‚Äôt mythologize the office**: Problems are solved with processes, not presence
10. **Respect disconnection**: Everyone has the right to switch off

## Conclusion

**Remote-first** isn‚Äôt a slogan, it‚Äôs a way to respect everyone‚Äôs time and presence (physical or virtual).
**Good luck**, and may the pajamas (or the blazer) be with you! üéâ
